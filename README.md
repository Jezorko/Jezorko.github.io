## Running locally

There is a plenty of great documentation available on [Jekyll's website](https://jekyllrb.com/).
The following is just a quick tl;dr:

 1. install Ruby (instructions [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/))
 2. next, install `bundler` and `jekyll` gems with ```gem install bundler jekyll```
 3. install project-specific gems with ```bundle install```
 4. finally, start the server: ```bundle exec jekyll serve```
